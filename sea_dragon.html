    <h2>Sea Dragon</h2>
    
    <hr>

    <p>The Sea Dragon was an extremely large rocket, so large in fact that it would destory any launchpad that it was launched from, and so had to be launched out of the ocean, hence its name. The Sea Dragon was large enough to carry 550 tonnes to orbit, for reference, the International Space Station weights 420 tonnes. The Sea Dragon was designed to have a very large, but very simple and therefore cheap booster (Sometimes known as "Big Dumb Booster"), which would reduce costs. Costs would also be reduced by launching from the ocean, as it wouldn't need many systems to support it. The concept was proved workable when a modified Aerobee rocket was successfully fired underwater. Despite this, NASA never had a need for such a large rocket, so it was never built.</p>

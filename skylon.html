    <p>Skylon is the most recent concept featured, being publicly revealed in 1993. Skylon was a British spaceplane concept designed by Reaction Engines Limited, which aimed to be what is known as an SSTO (Single Stage To Orbit), meaning that it could reach orbit without using stages, or sections of a rocket that are jettisoned once they are no longer needed. This would mean that Skylon could be entirely reused after each flight, much like a normal aeroplane. To achieve this, it would have used the SABRE (Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine) system, which could work as a jet engine, which is more efficient but needs to take in air from the atmosphere, and then switch over to a rocket engine once the atmosphere becomes too thin to sustain a jet engine. Skylon was one of the longest-lasting concepts featured, but work on it unfortunately ended in 2024 when Reaction Engines Limited went into debt.</p>
